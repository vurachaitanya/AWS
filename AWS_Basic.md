## AWS Objects


### SID :
- The Sid (statement ID) is an optional identifier that you provide for the policy statement. You can assign a Sid value to each statement in a statement array. In services that let you specify an ID element, such as SQS and SNS, the Sid value is just a sub-ID of the policy document's ID. In IAM, the Sid value must be unique within a JSON policy.
- The Sid element supports uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers.
- In IAM, the Sid is not exposed in the IAM API. You can't retrieve a particular statement based on this ID.
- `"Sid": "1"`

### AssumeRole:
- [AWS Reff Doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html)
- Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use AssumeRole within your account or for cross-account access
- You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call AssumeRole. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call AssumeRole.

**Example:** For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts


### AWS Organizations :
- [AWS Reff](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/)
- [Advt of Org](https://segment.com/blog/segment-aws-organizations/)
- AWS Organizations helps you centrally manage and govern your environment as you grow and scale your AWS resources. Using AWS Organizations, you can programmatically create new AWS accounts and allocate resources, group accounts to organize your workflows, apply policies to accounts or groups for governance, and simplify billing by using a single payment method for all of your accounts.
- In addition, AWS Organizations is integrated with other AWS services so you can define central configurations, security mechanisms, audit requirements, and resource sharing across accounts in your organization. AWS Organizations is available to all AWS customers at no additional charge.



### AWS Organizational Units (OU's):
- You can group your accounts into organizational units (OUs) and attach different access policies to each OU. For example, if you have accounts that must access only the AWS services that meet certain regulatory requirements, you can put those accounts into one OU. You then can attach a policy to that OU that blocks access to services that do not meet those regulatory requirements. You can nest OUs within other OUs to a depth of five levels, providing flexibility in how you structure your account groups.

### Service Control Policies (SCPs) : [AWS Reff](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html)
- [Org SCP Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_create.html)
- Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization. SCPs help you to ensure your accounts stay within your organizationâ€™s access control guidelines. SCPs are available only in an organization that has all features enabled. SCPs aren't available if your organization has enabled only the consolidated billing features.
- SCP defines a guardrail, or sets limits, on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users and roles in the affected accounts.
- The administrator must still attach identity-based or resource-based policies to IAM users or roles, or to the resources in your accounts to actually grant permissions. The effective permissions are the logical intersection between what is allowed by the SCP and what is allowed by the IAM and resource-based policies.
- Users and roles must still be granted permissions with appropriate IAM permission policies. A user without any IAM permission policies has no access, even if the applicable SCPs allow all services and all actions.



### AWS X-Ray :
- [AWS Reff Doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray.html)
- AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves, and provides tools you can use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization. For any traced request to your application, you can see detailed information not only about the request and response, but also about calls that your application makes to downstream AWS resources, microservices, databases and HTTP web APIs.
- Instead of sending trace data directly to X-Ray, the SDK sends JSON segment documents to a daemon process listening for UDP traffic. The X-Ray daemon buffers segments in a queue and uploads them to X-Ray in batches. The daemon is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS, and is included on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS Lambda platforms.
- X-Ray uses trace data from the AWS resources that power your cloud applications to generate a detailed service graph. The service graph shows the client, your front-end service, and backend services that your front-end service calls to process requests and persist data. Use the service graph to identify bottlenecks, latency spikes, and other issues to solve to improve the performance of your applications.

### AWS Simple Notification Service :
- [AWS Reff Doc](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc)
- Amazon Simple Notification Service is a notification service provided as part of Amazon Web Services since 2010. It provides a low-cost infrastructure for the mass delivery of messages, predominantly to mobile users.
- Fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication.
- The A2P functionality enables you to send messages to users at scale via SMS, mobile push, and email.



### AWS CloudTrail :
- [AWS Reff Doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
- AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting. In addition, you can use CloudTrail to detect unusual activity in your AWS accounts. These capabilities help simplify operational analysis and troubleshooting.

### AWS Config :
- [AWS Reff Doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html)
-  AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.
- An AWS resource is an entity you can work with in AWS, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, a security group, or an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 


###  Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) :  [AWS Reff](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html)
- Amazon software that can be installed and configured on an EC2 instance, an on-premises server, or a virtual machine (VM). SSM Agent makes it possible for Systems Manager to update, manage, and configure these resources. The agent processes requests from the Systems Manager service in the AWS Cloud, and then runs them as specified in the request. SSM Agent then sends status and execution information back to the Systems Manager service by using the Amazon Message Delivery Service (service prefix: ec2messages).


### AWS Marketplace Management Portal : [AWS Reff](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/marketplace-management-portal-user-access.html)
- AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that make it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on AWS.
