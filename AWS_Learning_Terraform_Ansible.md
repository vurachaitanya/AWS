1.	Amazon elastic kubernetes services (EKS)
2.	Data plane and Control plane 
3.	Desired state is defined which is so called as declarative.
4.	Terraform can be used with any cloud vendor and its cloud agnostic.
5.	Terraform uses declarative templates called HCL (Hashicorp configuration language)/
6.	User must backup the state files for keeping track of local or remote state of file’s
7.	Terraform offers vide variety of modules and providers for working with cloud and on prem systems.
8.	Agent less, API is integrated.
9.	Ansible are configuration management and infrastructure deployment tool. Popular for CM.
10.	Ansible will not store/track the state of infrastructure deployments. 
11.	Ansible supports Procedural (Ad-hock tasks) and declarative modules (AWS,etc) 
12.	[Terraformuserpolicy json format created]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxacademy/content-deploying-to-aws-ansible-terraform/master/iam_policies/terraform_deployment_iam_policy.json)  
13.	As a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user access keys for any task where it's not required. Instead, create a new administrator IAM user with access keys for yourself
14.	IAM Access, user:chaitu, 
15.	Group:chaitugroup,
16.	 AWS access type: Programmatic access and AWS Management Console access,
17.	Console password type :Autogenerated,
18.	Require password reset: Yes,
19.	Permissions boundary: Permissions boundary is not set,
20.	Tags: user:admin, awsiam:admin
21.	Created ADMIN IAM Access and given console and cli access and got the token/secrets and configured using `aws configure –profile <User Name>`
22.	` aws iam list-groups --profile chaitu` command to check the group to which your user is been added to.

#### AWS S3 Bucket creation :
-	` aws s3api create-bucket --bucket terraformstatebucketbkp543 --region us-west-2 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2 --profile chaitu ` create s3 bucket to store terraform states to S3 bucket. 
-	`http://terraformstatebucketbkp5431.s3.amazonaws.com/`  bucket is been created for above command
- Tf file creation for storing the tf states to S3 bucket.
```
root@chaitu:~# cat backend.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">=0.12.0"
  backend "s3" {
    region  = "us-west-2"
    profile = "chaitu"
    key     = "terraformstatefile"
    bucket  = "terraformstatebucketbkp5431"
  }
}
